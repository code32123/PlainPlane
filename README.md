# PlainPlane
This is the main project folder of PlainPlane, which is my first unity game.

## How to play
So that I don't have to constantly update this document, the in-game help will be the most up-to-date. However, the basics of flying are:
 + w/s               - Throttle
 + a/d               - Yaw? left and right.
 + Side Arrows       - Roll
 + Vertical Arrows   - Pitch
 + space, e, r, f    - Weapons (See in-game help)
 + x                 - landing gear
 + esc/p             - pause

## Issues? Suggestions?
 + Have any problems? Post an issue!
 + Want me to post a build for a specific platform? Post an issue! (I havn't tried building for mac, as I don't have access to one I can test it on. If your willing to try it though, let me know!)
 + Feature requests, from big to small, are welcome!
 + Pull requests are also welcome!
